**Executive Summary**

## Business Context

Andersen Corporation is currently challenged by fragmented shift
scheduling at its plant, resulting in operational inefficiencies and
misalignment between departments. The presence of too many distinct
schedules has led to suboptimal productivity and limited workforce
cohesion. Andersen Corporation recognizes the need to streamline its
scheduling system to enhance plant performance while maintaining a
supportive and engaged workforce.

Andersen Corporation's primary objectives are to:

-   **Reduce the number of shift schedules** to improve efficiency and
    reduce complexity.

    to ensure seamless production flow.

-   **Enhance workforce engagement** by involving employees in the
    scheduling process to improve satisfaction and morale.

-   **Achieve productivity gains** through the implementation of
    schedules that are operationally effective and preferred by
    employees.

    implementation guidelines, and, if required, customized pay and work
    policies.
