**[Introduction to the Shiftwork Solutions process]{.underline}**

In an on

To address these issues, we've partnered with Shiftwork Solutions, a
consulting firm out of California that specialized in working with shift
workers and shiftwork operations. We've tasked them with answering the
following questions:

1.  What is the right amount of staffing for our operation?

2.  What is the best schedule or schedules for our business and our
    workforce?

3.  What is the right amount of overtime for our employees (not too much
    and not too little)?

We chose Shiftwork Solutions because of their approach which focuses on
both (1) the needs of the business and (2) the needs of the workforce.

The first phase of the project focuses on the business. They need to
know our current and ideal staffing. They will look at a wide range of
scheduling issues ranging from coverage requirements and absenteeism
coverage to overtime distribution.

In this first phase of the project, they will be conducting interviews
with department managers and some of their staff. We are distributing a
list of the types of things they will be discussing with you in these
interviews. It's helpful to be as prepared as possible but we understand
that everyone's plate is pretty full at the moment.

The interviews will be conducted online using Microsoft Teams. You will
receive an invite to a meeting at some time over the next couple of
weeks.

Phase II of the project is all about engaging the workforce to find out
what they want from a schedule; hours, patterns, overtime, etc. We
expect to start that part of the project in mid-January.

Let us all get behind this important project. A big success in this
effort will make all of our lives better.
