***Introduction***

Our facility is using an 8-hour rotating schedule commonly called The
Southern Swing. This is a pattern that has long since fallen out of
favor with most shiftwork operations; mostly due to the seven days in a
row of work and only one weekend off a month. Shift workers find it
fatiguing and companies find it difficult to hire new people willing to
work such a schedule.

Shiftwork Solutions LLC was called in to show the workforce alternative
ways for covering 24/7. This was done using a survey that was
administered in early January of 2024. The results of that survey showed
a significant amount of interest in a 12-hour rotating pattern commonly
referred to as "The Dupont."

This document is intended to provide comparative information about both,
the current schedule and the Dupont. The goal is to allow the workforce
to choose their preferred option between these two using the information
provided here to help with that decision.

***Schedule Selection Process***

The selection process will involve the workforce reviewing this document
and then turning in the back page to indicate their preference. The
Question and Answers section will cover the agreed upon work and pay
policies that will be used in support of the Dupont schedule, should the
workforce elect to implement it.

Everyone will have a few days to review the contents of this document
before using the last page (Preference Form) to let the company and
union know what you want to do.

**[24/7 Option #1: Current 8-hour schedule]{.underline}**

![](media/image2.emf)

> n8: 8-hour night shift (11:00 pm to 7:00 am)
>
> d8: 8-hour day shift (7:00 am to 3:00 pm)
>
> s8: 8-hour second shift (3:00 pm to 11:00 pm)

**How the schedule works**

This schedule is staffed using 4 crews. There is a crew in each week of
the 4-week cycle. At the end of each week, each crew rotates down to the
next week in the cycle. The crew completing week 4 will rotate up to the
first week of the cycle.

Nights are the last shift of the day. This means that as you look down,
for example, on Friday, of the 3 shifts that show up that day, the night
shift is the first, working from 11:00 pm Friday night until 7:00 am on
Saturday.

There are three notable things about this schedule.

1.  The schedule rotates so every time you come back from a break you
    are on a different shift.

2.  When you return from a break, you will work 7 days in a row.

3.  Once every 4 weeks, there is a 4-day weekend. In the schedule above,
    that weekend begins at 3:00 pm on Friday of week 1 and ends at 11:00
    pm on Wednesday of week 2.

**[24/7 Option #2]{.underline}**: The Dupont 12-hour schedule

![](media/image3.emf)

> N12: 12-hour night shift (6:30 pm to 6:30 am)
>
> D12: 12-hour day shift (6:30 am to 6:30 pm)

**How the schedule works**

This schedule is staffed using 4 crews. There is a crew in each week of
the 4-week cycle. At the end of each week, each crew rotates down to the
next week in the cycle. The crew completing week 4 will rotate up to the
first week of the cycle.

Nights are the last shift of the day. This means that as you look down,
for example, on Tuesday, of the 2 shifts that show up that day, the
night shift is the last. A night shift shown on Tuesday will start
Tuesday night and end Wednesday morning.

Working through a 4-week cycle:

**Week 1**: You work from 6:30 am until 6:30 pm on Monday -- Thursday.
After you get off Thursday evening, you're off on Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday before rotating down to week 2.

**Week 2:** You are off on Monday through Thursday, returning to work on
Friday night a 6:30 pm. You get off your Friday night shift at 6:30 am
on Saturday. You then work a Saturday night and a Sunday night shift
before rotating down to week 3.

**Week 3:** You work Monday night from 6:30 pm until 6:30 am on Tuesday.
You are then off on the rest of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. You
return to work at 6:30 am on Friday and work until 6:30 pm. You do this
again on Saturday and Sunday before rotating down to week 4.

**Week 4:** You are off on Monday, returning to work at 6:30 pm on
Tuesday. You get off the Tuesday night shift at 6:30 am on Wednesday.
You then work a Wednesday and a Thursday night shift with the last shift
ending at 6:30 am on Friday. You are then off for the rest of Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday before rotating up to week 1.

**Questions and Answers**

**[Question #1:]{.underline}** Why are we looking at 24/7 12-hour
schedule?

**[Answer #1:]{.underline}** The workforce has been indicating a desire
for a new schedule for quite some time. We are looking at alternatives
to see if this is something the majority of our employees want to try
out.

**[Question #2:]{.underline}** Why would anyone want a 12-hour schedule?

**[Answer #2:]{.underline}** While the reasons vary, they can be summed
up in 3 words: "More days off."

The current 24/7 schedule has 273 scheduled days of work per year. That
is before any unscheduled overtime. The 12-hour option has 182 scheduled
days of work per year before any unscheduled overtime. Both schedules
have access to unscheduled overtime so that additional income should be
considered the same regardless of the schedule.

**[Question #3]{.underline}**: What are our options?

**[Answer #3:]{.underline}** For those currently working the 8-hour,
24/7 schedule the choices are:

1.  Keep the current schedule

2.  Try the 12-hour, rotating 24/7 schedule known as the Dupont

**[Question #4:]{.underline}** How will the new schedule affect my pay.

**[Answer #4:]{.underline}** The current schedule averages 42 hours of
work per week and 43 hours of pay per week (before unscheduled
overtime). The Dupont schedule averages 42 hours of work per week and 44
hours of pay per week (before any unscheduled overtime). [See Appendix A
for the calculations.]{.underline}

**[Question #5:]{.underline}** How will the new schedule be chosen?

**[Answer #5:]{.underline}** The last page of this document is a
Preference Form. On that page, you will indicate your preference for a
24/7 schedule. You will turn your completed form into the union hall. If
the majority want to try the Dupont schedule, it will be implemented in
early April 2024.

**[Question #6]{.underline}**: How will overtime be paid on the 12-hour
schedule.

**[Answer #6:]{.underline}** On the 12-hour schedule, overtime will be
paid at time and one-half for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in
a week and in excess of 12 hours in a day.

**[Question #7]{.underline}**: If we choose the new schedule, will it be
for a trial period?

**[Answer #7:]{.underline}** Yes. A new schedule, if chosen, will be in
place from April 2024 until April 2025. After that time, if no action is
taken to make the schedule permanent, you will automatically return to
your current schedule.

If, at any time during the trial, the company finds that absentee
coverage is not working or the schedule becomes a safety or productivity
concern, the schedule will revert back to the current schedule with 30
days' notice. If the union wants to stop the trial early, they can do so
with 30 days notice if two-thirds of the workforce indicates they want
to do so.

**[Question #8:]{.underline}** What will the hours be for the 12-hour
shifts?

**[Answer #8:]{.underline}** The 12-hour Day shift will go from 6:30 am
until 6:30 pm. The 12-hour Night shift will go from 6:30 pm until 6:30
am the following morning.

**[Question #9:]{.underline}** How will vacations work?

**[Answer #9:]{.underline}** On the 12-hour schedule, vacation will be
taken and paid in hours. If you miss a 12-hour shift, you will be paid
for 12 hours and 12 hours will be charged to your account. On 12-hour
schedules, it is often seen as beneficial to take off a "block" of days.
A "block" is defined as a group of consecutive days of work that are
proceeded and followed by a group of days off. If you choose to take a
"block" off, you will not be subjected to mandatory overtime during the
week that contains the majority of your vacation time. For example, if
you take vacation on the 4 night shifts starting on Friday of week 2 and
ending on Monday of week 3, your days off in week 2 will not be
subjected to mandatory overtime.

Vacation pay is currently either 2% of your earnings from the previous
year or 44 pay hours, whichever is greater. This is based on the idea
that a typical week of vacation is equivalent to 40 hours of vacation.
[See Appendix B for Vacation Pay calculations]{.underline}.

[Calculating the Percent Method]{.underline}

To convert to hours, you would get 2% divided by 40 hours for each hour.

.02/40 = .0005 or .05% per hour.

So, if you take 48 hours off, you would get 48 times .05% which comes to
2.4%. If you take 36 hours off, you would get 36 time .05% which comes
to 1.8%. Taking 48 hours gets you more money but uses up your vacation
faster.

[Calculating the 44 pay hours method]{.underline}

Each hour is paid at 44/40 or 10% extra per hour. So, missing 48 hours
will give you 48 plus 4.8 hours of pay or 52.8 pay hours. Missing 36
hours will give you 36 plus 3.6 hours of pay or 39.6 pay hours.

**[Question #10:]{.underline}** How will holidays work?

**[Answer #10:]{.underline}** We currently recognized 14 holidays a
year, seven scheduled holidays and 7 floating holidays. On the 12-hour
schedule, there will be a total of 12 holidays, seven scheduled and 5
floating holidays. You will continue to get 8 hours of Holiday Pay for
each scheduled holiday but you will get 12 hours of pay for each
floating holiday. You will continue to be paid at time and one-half for
all hours worked on a holiday. This is in addition to Holiday Pay. [See
Appendix C for pay calculations related to holidays]{.underline}.

Southern Swing: Time off with 7 floating holidays: 7 times 8 hours = 56
hours

> Pay for 7 floating holidays: 7 times 8 hours = 56 pay hours

Dupont: Time off with 5 floating holidays: 5 times 12 hours = 60 hours

> Pay for 5 floating holidays: 5 times 12 hours = 60 hours

**[Question #11:]{.underline}** How will shift differentials be paid on
the 12-hour schedule?

**[Answer #11:]{.underline}** On the 12-hour schedule, employees on the
24/7 Night Shift schedule will receive a shift differential of
\$0.30/hour for the entire night shift.

**[Question #12:]{.underline}** Will there be a Stand-by system for the
12-hour schedule?

**[Answer #12:]{.underline}** Covering short-notice absences on a
12-hour schedule is different than doing so on an 8-hour schedule.
Currently, if someone doesn't show up for work at the last minute, the
person in that position will stay over. This is not something that
should routinely happen on 12-hour shifts.

When people first here this, it's not unusual to hear "I knew there was
catch! Now we have to come in on our days off so why bother with 12-hour
shifts?"

The math actually clarifies this. If you stay on your current schedule,
you have 91 days off per year. However, you don't have to come in on
those days off. You come in early or stay late. So, for example, if you
provide 120 hours of absentee coverage during a year, you will keep your
91 days off but 30 of your workdays will have been converted to 12-hour
shifts.

On the other hand, on a 12-hour schedule, you have 182 days off per
year. If you provide 120 hours of coverage on that schedule, you will
lose 10 of your days off so you will end up with only 172 days off per
year. This is 81 more days off that your current schedule with the same
amount of unscheduled overtime.

Most absentee coverage for things like vacation, can be scheduled in
advance. Overtime can be posted and distributed in accordance with the
current contract language, and no one needs to worry about last minute
coverage\...unless, someone calls off at the last minute.

Last minute coverage means that some will have to come in on their day
off when they weren't expecting to.

To be clear, this is in reference to a position that MUST BE FILLED for
the facility to operate safely. Not only must it be filled, there is
also no one available on that shift to cover it.

Telephone calls or text messages will need to be used to find someone
that can come in. If no one comes in, the facility must either shut down
or operate with short staffing.

Since neither of these options is acceptable, companies rely on a
standby system. This is a policy in which there is always someone
assigned to answer the phone and come in for a short period of time
around shift changes. [See Appendix D for what a system may look
like]{.underline}.

The company can design a system that guarantees coverage, or the union
can. In either case, coverage must be guaranteed, or the schedule will
revert to the current 8-hour pattern. Putting in a schedule that causes
occasional stoppages is in no one's best interest.

Shiftwork Solutions has found that shift workers step up to the plate
and answer their phones when it is understood that failure to do so will
cause the 12-hour schedule to go away.

However, old habits are hard to break. On 8-hour schedules, there are
not a lot of days off so people may have historically avoided answering
the call when it comes in. This needs to change on 12-hour shifts.

Shiftwork Solutions recommends a 3-Flag System. In this system, there is
no standby program. Instead, the company agrees that it will allow two
failures of a voluntary system before either (1) reverting to the old
8-hour schedule or (b) putting in a mandatory standby system.

Each failure is a Flag.

Flag 1: There was a short notice absence, and no one would come in to
fill it. Everyone is notified that this first flag has occurred.

Flag 2: There was a short notice absence, and no one would come in to
fill it. Everyone is notified that this second flag has occurred.

Flag 3: There was a short notice absence, and no one would come in to
fill it. Either the old 8-hour schedule is implemented, or a mandatory
standby system is put in place.

This gives the workforce the ability to avoid a standby system. No one
wants to implement such a system but if no one comes in to cover short
notice absences, then such a system is the only way to make the 12-hour
schedule work.

**[Question #13:]{.underline}** Will we continue to be paid weekly?

**[Answer #13:]{.underline}** Yes.

**[Question #14:]{.underline}** What will be the shift differential paid
to the night shift?

**[Answer #14:]{.underline}** The current schedule pays \$6.48 for the
8-hour night shift. This will be spread across all 12 night shift hours
at the rate of \$.54 per hour.

**Appendix A -- Pay Calculations**

Pay is based on your hourly rate and the number of "pay hours" that you
earn. Pay rate times pay hours = total pay. For example, if you make
\$35 an hour and work all 4 weeks of your current schedule (and nothing
else), you will work an average of 42 hours per week and be paid an
average of 43 hours per week. The average weekly check would be 43 x
\$35 = \$1,505.

**[Income if you just work your basic schedule:]{.underline}**

![](media/image4.emf)

To find out how much money You earn on an average week, before
unscheduled overtime, multiply your hourly wage rate time 43 pay hours.

**[Income if you just work the basic Dupont, 12-hour
schedule:]{.underline}**

![](media/image5.emf)

To find out how much money you earn on an average week, before
unscheduled overtime, multiply your hourly wage rate time 44 pay hours.
So, if you make \$35 and hour, your average weekly income (before any
unscheduled overtime) would be 44 x \$35 = \$1,540.

**Appendix B -- Vacation Pay Calculations**

[Calculating the Percent Method]{.underline}

To convert pay from weekly to hours, you would divide 2% by 40 hours for
each hour.

.02/40 = .0005 or .05% per hour.

So, if you take 48 hours off, you would get 48 times .05% which comes to
2.4% of the previous year's income. If you take 36 hours off, you would
get 36 times.05% which comes to 1.8% of the previous years income.
Taking 48 hours gets you more money but uses up your vacation faster.

[Calculating the 44 pay hours method]{.underline}

Each hour is paid at 44/40 or 10% extra per hour. So, missing 48 hours
will give you 48 plus 4.8 hours of pay or 52.8 pay hours. Missing 36
hours will give you 36 plus 3.6 hours of pay or 39.6 pay hours.

**Appendix C -- Holiday Time off and Pay Calculations**

[Floating Holidays (7 on Southern Swing and 5 on the
Dupont)]{.underline}

**Southern Swing**: Time off with **7** floating holidays: 7 times 8
hours = **56 hours off work**

> Pay for **7** floating holidays: 7 times 8 hours = **56 hours of pay**

**Dupont:** Time off with **5** floating holidays: 5 times 12 hours =
**60 hours off work**

> Pay for **5** floating holidays: 5 times 12 hours = **60 hours of
> pay**

[Scheduled Holidays (7 total)]{.underline}

**Southern Swing**: You are scheduled to work 75% of the days so you
will work 75% of the scheduled holidays. This comes to 75% times 7
holidays times 8 hours = 42 hours of work on scheduled holidays. Each of
these days has an extra 50% pay so you would make an additional 21 pay
hours from working on a holiday. Additionally, you get 8 hours of pay
for each holiday which is an additional 56 hours of pay. Total
additional income from scheduled holidays is 21 + 56 = **77 pay hours**.

**Dupont:** You are scheduled to work 50% of the days so you will work
50% of the scheduled holidays. This comes to 50% times 7 holidays times
12 hours = 42 hours of work on scheduled holidays. Each of these days
has an extra 50% pay so you would make an additional 21 pay hours from
working on a holiday. Additionally, you get 8 hours of pay for each
holiday which is an additional 56 hours of pay. Total additional income
from scheduled holidays is 21 + 56 = **77 pay hours**

Note: Hours worked on Christmas will continue to be paid at the
double-time rate.

**Appendix D -- Sample Stand-By Policy**

A stand-by policy exists to serve only one purpose -- to ensure that
coverage is available for short notice or no notice absence.

Absences such as vacation or long-term disability are foreseeable and
thus, should be covered using existing policies. However, on a 12-hour
schedule, if someone calls off at the last minute, and no replacement
can be found, then someone ends up working beyond a 12-hour shift which
is considered unsafe and thus, unacceptable.

Here are some guidelines for a typical stand-by policy:

1.  To be on stand-by means that one must be reachable by telephone for
    some time on their day off. Typically, this period extends from 15
    minutes before a shift change to 15 minutes after a shift change.

2.  Since there are 2 shift changes per day, there will be 2 standby
    periods per day.

3.  The person on stand-by cannot be assigned mandatory overtime on the
    day they are on stand-by.

4.  Sufficient numbers should be on standby to ensure a reasonable
    expectation that any short notice absence can be covered. This
    number is typically around one person per 10 people that are
    scheduled off.

5.  The person on stand-by cannot be contacted and called in for any
    purpose other than covering a last-minute absence.

6.  People should be assigned stand-by several weeks in advance.

7.  People on standby should be allowed to trade or simply give up their
    stand-by position to someone else that wants it.

8.  Being on standby is not a paid position. The benefit is that you
    cannot be assigned mandatory overtime on the days you are on
    stand-by. Additionally, the very existence of a stand-by system
    means that not having one does not work and thus, you either have
    such a system or you go to an 8-hour shift schedule.

The following schedule shows what stand-by positions should be filled by
which crew on the Dupont schedule:

![](media/image6.emf)

Two considerations go into this schedule: (1) you can's be on stand-by
if it may cause you to work 24 hours in a row and (2) protect the long
break from stand-by as much as is possible.

**Appendix E -- Unscheduled Overtime and Days Off**

On the Southern Swing, overtime is worked by extending a regularly
scheduled shift. On a 12-hour schedule, overtime is worked on a day off.

Let's assume that you work no double shifts, no 16's, on the Southern
Swing. As you work more and more overtime, more and more of your 8-hour
shifts become 12-hour shifts. For example, if you average 6 hours of
overtime a week for a year, you will end up having worked 195 8-hour
shifts and 78 12-hour shifts. However, since we don't work overtime on a
day off, you will always have 91 days off regardless of how much
overtime you work.

On a 12-hour schedule, the more overtime you work, the fewer days off
you have. For example, you start with 182 days off but, if you work an
average of 6 hours of overtime a week for a year, you will end up
working 208 12-hour shifts and having 156 days off.

Use the chart below by entering the number of unscheduled you think you
may be working on an average week for the next 12 months. You can then
compare the Southern Swing with the Dupont by following that row across
the page.
