## Key Challenges Addressed

### 1. Work-Life Balance

**Priority Level:** #1 concern across nearly every industry

**Current Workforce Trends:**
- Today's workforce wants involvement in decision-making
- High value placed on technology and recognition
- Different definition of work-life balance per individual
- Could mean: job security, overtime access, weekends off, flexible schedules, or maximum time off

**Company Approach:**
- Focus on making employees "sticky"
- Allow workforce to express work-life balance needs
- Create environment that helps achieve balance
- Key to attracting and retaining talent

### 2. Employee Engagement

**Definition:** Level of enthusiasm and dedication a worker feels toward their job

**Benefits of Engaged Workforce:**
- More productive
- Solves problems
- Enjoys work environment
- Stays with company
- Spreads positive word (employer of choice)
- Feels valued and delivers on growth targets

**Shiftwork Solutions Approach:**
- Employee engagement from week one
- Proven process: communication meetings, surveys, feedback sessions
- Draws workforce into project participation
- Minimal anxiety during process
- Maximum support for final solution
- Sometimes used even when schedule change is optional

### 3. Asset Utilization

**Context:** In computerized manufacturing, asset utilization is a huge economic driver

**Key Statistics:**
- 168 available operating hours per week = 100% utilization
- Traditional 5-day/24-hour schedule = 120 hours/week = 71.4% utilization
- With 85% operational efficiency: actual utilization = 60.7%
- Potential improvement: 40% capacity increase without new equipment

**Financial Impact:**
- Expanding schedule can save millions in capital investment
- Example: $25M investment delayed 2.5 years = $6.25M savings at 10% cost of capital
- Allows more efficient use of most expensive equipment

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Not all departments need 7-day operation
- Some need reserve capacity for seasonal demands
- Operate expensive/efficient equipment 7 days, keep older equipment as reserve

### 4. Shift Lengths

**Historical Context:**
- 12-hour shifts common when shiftwork began
- Laws requiring overtime after 8 hours ended this practice
- Modern laws mostly eliminate mandatory overtime after 8 hours/day
- Federal law still mandates overtime after 40 hours/week

**Annual Hours Calculation:**
- 2,080 hours/year at 40 hours/week can be achieved by:
  - 260 8-hour shifts
  - 208 10-hour shifts
  - 173.3 12-hour shifts

**Trade-offs:**
- Longer shifts = more total days off
- Longer shifts = less time off on work days

**Considerations for Longer Shifts:**
- Can employees work more consecutive hours safely?
- Environmental conditions (heat, noise, toxins, physical labor)
- Pay and work policies need review
- Different fixed shifts may prefer different patterns
- What does workforce want?
- Does it make business sense?

**Optimization Questions:**
- Need to cover 24 hours every day?
- Shift overlap required?
- Travel time to worksite?
- Maintenance/sanitation cycle?
- Industry regulations?
- Impact on coordination with suppliers/customers?

**Employee Preference:** When focused only on time-off, most prefer 10-hour shifts, but 10-hour shifts don't divide well into 24 hours for level coverage

### 5. Employee Surveys & Analysis

**Purpose:**
- Understand how shift workers feel about current schedule
- Identify liked features and improvement areas
- Understand workforce priorities (sleep, alertness, safety)
- Communicate reason for schedule change
- Involve workforce in the solution

**Survey System Features:**
- Three sequential surveys, each building on previous results
- Administered online (computer or cell phone accessible)
- Includes introductory and explanatory videos
- Comprehensive communications with workforce

**Survey Analysis Includes:**
- Graphic depiction of results
- Comparison to average shift worker database
- Detailed numerical results in tables
- Cross-referencing by demographics (seniority, age, gender, etc.)
- Schedule concept evaluation (rated "no way" to "perfect")
- Data analysis and interpretation

**Database:** Maintains database of shift worker responses accessible by:
- Industry type
- Shift worker age
- Gender
- Other demographic factors

### 6. Shift Work Policies

**Critical Policy Areas:**
- Overtime distribution
- Holiday pay and premium
- Vacation scheduling and usage
- Shift differential
- Breaks and lunches
- Attendance systems
- Meal pay
- Funeral leave
- Bereavement

**Common Problems with Old Policies:**
- **Unbalanced workweeks:** Results in overtime some weeks, <40 hours in others
- **Vacation tracking:** Traditional days/weeks don't work when day ≠ 8 hours
- **Holiday pay:** Complex questions about payment for non-scheduled holidays
- **Double-time:** Either employee loses opportunities or company costs increase
- **Overtime/absence coverage:** How to cover 12-hour shift absences fairly

**Policy Design Goals:**
- Protect employee compensation for same hours worked
- Protect company from increased labor costs
- Ensure workforce can make same money on new schedule
- Create policies tailored to specific shift schedule, company, and employees

### 7. Rotating vs. Fixed Shifts

**Fixed Shifts:**
- Crews always work same shift
- Employees generally prefer fixed shifts

**Rotating Shifts:**
- Crews change shifts on regular basis (often weekly)
- Employers generally prefer rotating shifts

**Decision Factors:**
1. Employee preferences
2. Health concerns
3. Business needs
4. Staffing requirements

**Management Issues with Fixed Shifts:**
- Management oversight challenges
- Communication disparities between shifts
- Training difficulties
- Skill balance between crews
- Recruiting and retention complications
- Night shift often feels disconnected from management

### 8. Lean Manufacturing Integration

**Lean Principles Supported:**
- Continuous flow production
- Just-In-Time (JIT)
- Total Quality Management (TQM)
- Statistical Process Control (SPC)
- Pull production
- Level production

**How Customized Shift Schedules Improve Lean:**
- Match flows on shop floor
- Balance labor resources between production stations
- Flex up/down to respond to customer demands
- Create training and cross-training opportunities
- Integrate preventative maintenance into schedule

**Benefits of 7-Day Schedules for Lean:**

**Relieve Bottlenecks:**
- Run bottleneck areas more hours than rest of facility
- Eliminate upstream backlog
- Reduce W.I.P. (Work in Process)

- Lower inventory costs
- Faster responsiveness to order changes

**Reduce Cycle Times:**
- Eliminate weekend "wait time"
- Avoid production ramps before/after shutdowns
- Continuous production flow
- Faster turnaround

**Reduce W.I.P.:**
- Stretching production across 7 days can reduce W.I.P. by 28%+
- Less inventory between processes
- Faster response to quality problems

**Reduce Warehouse Inventories:**
- Lower finished goods inventory going into weekend
- Can represent 15% reduction in average volume
- Weekend production enables weekend shipping
- Better return on inventory investment

**Improve Customer Responsiveness:**
- No weekend delays
- Orders received and processed any day of the week
- Friday orders ready for Saturday shipment

### 9. Managing Overtime

**Strategic Use:**
- When used properly, overtime is powerful tool for meeting workload demands
- Can minimize costs while improving coverage
- Helps control overtime spending
- Protects productivity and margins

**Note:** Many 24/7 operations are over-staffed to avoid overtime, but this can be more expensive than leaving scheduled overtime in place

### 10. Implementation Support

**Why Companies Hesitate:**
- Juggling daily operations
- Lack time or tools
- Worry about employee pushback

**Shiftwork Solutions Support:**
- Provides structure, data, and experience
- Guides smooth, successful transition
- Manages process from start to finish

### 11. Building Consensus

**Challenge:** New schedules can trigger pushback when employees/unions feel excluded

**Approach:**
- Bring stakeholders into dialogue early
- Use workforce surveys
- Transparent communication
- Build trust
- Align interests
- Reach lasting consensus

### 12. Managing Growth

**Context:** Growing companies see increased sales/profits and stretched production facilities

**Solution:** Redesign shift schedules to keep pace with demand without:
- Burning out workforce
- Compromising performance

### 13. Managing Absenteeism

**Statistics:** Workers can be absent up to 10% of scheduled hours each year

**Impact:**
- Disrupts operations
- Drives up overtime
- Strains workforce

**Solution:** Design schedules that improve coverage and maintain smooth operations

### 14. Communication Challenges

**Problem:** Shiftwork creates communication gaps that traditional methods miss
- Different shifts
- Different days
- Different locations
- Causes confusion, errors, frustration

**Solution:** Implement best practices to address misalignment

### 15. Improving Productivity

**Focus Areas:**
- Boosting employee productivity
- Increasing overall production
- Reducing per-unit costs

**Issue:** Misaligned schedules limit throughput and inflate unit costs

**Solution:** Optimize shift design to boost plant performance and deliver ROI

### 16. Relieving Bottlenecks

**Reality:** Unless facility has infinite capacity or perfectly matched process flow, bottlenecks exist

**Impact:** If not staffed/scheduled properly, limits output across operation

**Solution:** Identify and relieve scheduling-related bottlenecks to unlock throughput

### 17. Skill Balance

**Common Concern:** "How can we avoid skill imbalance?"

**Critical Need:** Ensure right people with right skills are available when/where needed

**Solution:** Design schedules that:
- Minimize disruptions
- Keep operations running smoothly
- Balance skills across all shifts

### 18. Food Processing Sanitation

**Challenge:** Food industry has stringent cleanliness requirements requiring equipment downtime

**Solution:** Minimize downtime while meeting sanitation requirements, resulting in more production time

### 19. Sleep and Alertness

**Issue:** No one-size-fits-all answer for sleep needs, especially in shiftwork

**Approach:** Bring industry best practices to address:
- Fatigue management
- Safety concerns
- Alertness optimization

### 20. Pay Policies

**Challenge:** Changing shift schedules requires tailored pay policies

**Complexity:** Crafting fair, practical, compliant policies is time-consuming

**Solution:** Translate complex scheduling changes into clear, compliant pay policies that:
- Align with company goals
- Keep workforce on board
- Meet legal requirements

## Shiftwork Solutions Change Model

### Philosophy

**Core Belief:** Employee engagement does not happen by accident—it takes effort and leadership actively seeking opportunities to involve workforce

**Difference:** "We want an engaged workforce" vs "We actively engage our workforce"

### Shiftwork Environment Evaluation (SEE) Process

**Four Phases:**

**Phase 1: Establish Goals**
- Work with management team
- Establish clear goals for process

**Phase 2: Survey and Communication**
- Custom-design Shiftwork Environment Evaluation Survey
- Create communication plan explaining survey
- Administer and process survey

**Phase 3: Feedback Strengths and Weaknesses**
- Review survey results with management team
- Identify strengths (successes) and weaknesses (problem areas)
- Review survey results with workforce

**Phase 4: Follow-up**
- Growth and improvement are constants
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment

### Typical Problems Addressed

- **Retention:** Exit interviews show shift schedule is major reason employees leave
- **Recruiting:** Prospective employees reluctant to accept due to poor shift assignments
- **Alertness:** Employees not getting enough sleep, affecting quality, productivity, safety
- **Skill Imbalance:** Constant struggle to balance skills between crews
- **Overtime:** Either too much or too little
- **Communication:** Everyone wants more but unsure how to achieve it
- **Supervision:** Should supervisors stay with same crew or rotate?
- **Policies:** Best ways to handle holidays, shift differential, funeral leave, etc.
- **Absentee Coverage:** Last-minute absenteeism driving up costs, lowering morale
- **Training:** How to schedule and accomplish training predictably and effectively

## Shiftwork Perspectives: Employee vs. Management Viewpoints

### Communication Gap

**Statistic:** 70% of managers say they communicate well with shift workers, but 70% of shift workers say management communicates poorly

**Reality:** Different perspectives create opportunities for improvement through better, directed communications

### Employee Priorities

**1. Income Protection**
- Any schedule that lowers income will be rejected
- Overtime income contributes to lifestyle
- Common management mistake: assuming attractive day-off pattern compensates for income uncertainty

**2. Time Off Priorities**
- **Daily time off:** Varies by shift length
- **Days off between work blocks**
- **Weekend time off:** Top priority—allows quality time with family/friends
- **Long breaks:** Extended periods away from work

**3. Predictability**
- Unexpected overtime, canceled vacations, training changes make best schedules intolerable
- Shift workers give what it takes but want predictable time off

### Management vs. Worker Perspective

**Schedule Evaluation:**
- **Managers:** Immediately check if schedule provides required coverage
- **Workers:** Count weekends off, calculate vacation times, see who works Christmas, etc.

**Challenge:** Getting widespread support for new schedule despite different perspectives

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why use a consultant?

**Five Major Reasons:**

1. **Time:** Few managers can spare time needed for project of this magnitude

2. **Expertise:** Few managers have experience to successfully carry out this type of change, educate employees on full range of options, or thoroughly address concerns

3. **Employee Buy-in:** Outside neutral party minimizes belief that changes are management-dictated, leading to less resistance and more support

4. **Optimal Results:** Experts help identify most effective solutions, avoid surprises, increase likelihood of smooth transition and successful implementation

5. **Minimal Risk:** Extensive experience knows what works and doesn't, familiar with best practices, proven change management process, can avoid pitfalls

### What does a typical project look like?

Each project is customized to meet client needs. Projects range from:
- Simple: 15 employees, 2.5 hours of work
- Moderate: 30 employees with survey processing
- Complex: 65+ employees with thorough business analysis, survey administration, on-site work, union involvement

### Can you just mail me a new schedule?

**Short Answer:** Sure, but likely to be the wrong one

**Real Answer:** Schedule design is simplest part of improving shiftwork operations. Finding the right solution from everyone's perspective requires significant time and effort following proven process. Cannot guarantee workforce support without proper change management.

### Why not copy from nearby facility?

**Problem:** Any copied solution likely won't meet all specific needs:
- Unique staffing levels
- Different absence rates
- Specific maintenance issues
- Demand seasonality variations
- Growth/consolidation requirements
- Different workforce preferences

**Conclusion:** Best shiftwork solutions are tailored for each organization

### Can you work with union sites?

**Answer:** Yes, but complicated

**Approach:**
- Best solutions fit workforce needs and company needs
- Without worker support, constant fighting with scheduling issues
- If union and management agree better schedule lies outside contract:
  - Write timed addendum
  - Must meet everyone's approval
  - Allows schedule implementation outside contract for specified period
  - Very specific pay and work rules
  - Tests schedule on trial basis before contract incorporation

### How much do services cost?

**Pricing Models:**

1. **Project Basis:** Agreed fixed cost
   - Most projects result in operational savings
   - Costs recovered in 6 months or less
   - Improved bottom line annually

2. **Pay for Performance:** Compensation linked to realized value
   - Structured around actual opportunities company realizes

**Customization:** Every organization is different, so no standard service/fee list

### What shift schedule is most popular?

**Answer:** Schedules that are:
- Understood and supported by workforce
- Meet business requirements of organization

**Failures:**
- Schedules failing business requirements usually get replaced
- Schedules implemented without worker input are hard for workforce to accept

### What is the most popular shift length?

**Answer:** When focused solely on time-off effect, most shift workers prefer 10-hour shifts over 8-hour or 12-hour shifts

**Problem:** Many operations cannot use 10-hour shifts well because:
- 10-hour shift doesn't divide well into 24-hour day
- Difficult to get level coverage all 24 hours

### Do we need new software for better shift schedules?

**Answer:** No, specialized scheduling software not required to change work schedules

**Reality:**
- Scheduling software can assist in managing a schedule
- Success comes from collaborative process determining right schedule
- Can work with any current system: spreadsheets, basic tools, ERP systems, or pen and paper
- Software manages a schedule but won't determine best schedule for facility

**If Implementing New Software:** Can ensure maximum value from new tool

---

## Common Shift Schedule Types

### 8-Hour, 7-Day Schedule (Shift Schedule #1)

**Coverage:** 24 hours/day, 7 days/week

**Advantages:**
- Built-in overtime and shift premiums increase compensation
- About 273 workdays per year (91 day, 91 evening, 91 night shifts)
- One weekend out of four is off (13 weekends/year)
- Each weekend off is four days long
- Weekend follows day-shift for better time-off advantage
- Overtime normally worked on scheduled workday, making time-off predictable

**Disadvantages:**
- Weekly rotation increases fatigue levels
- Working seven consecutive shifts is tiring
- Working 14 out of 15 days in weeks 2-4 is very tiring, especially with half on night shift

**Variations:**
- Lunches may be paid or unpaid
- Shifts may be fixed or oscillating (2 rotate, 1 fixed)
- Variable staffing requirements
- Night shifts may be first or last shift of day
- Shift-breaker can reduce scheduled overtime

### Semi-Continuous, 6-Day Shift Schedule

**Context:** Many people consider shift work 5-day or 7-day proposition. Once overtime on weekends becomes too high, companies often try to "leap" to continuous operations.

**Challenge:** Leap from 5 to 7 days is difficult for:
- Company (operational challenges)
- Workforce (lifestyle changes)

**Alternative:** Consider 6-day schedules as intermediate step
