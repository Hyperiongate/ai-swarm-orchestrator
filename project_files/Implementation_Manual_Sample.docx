***Introduction***

In an ongoing effort to improve the work-life balance of our employees,
our company decided to look at our shiftwork schedules. The goal is to
ensure that we are offering the best possible work schedules for our
employees while meeting the needs of our customers.

We looked to Shiftwork Solutions for help in the Evaluation, Design, and
Implementation of our current schedule and/or any new schedule. This
document is the end result of their study.

After looking at things such as Shift Start Times, Overtime and Schedule
Patterns, it has been determined that the schedule options contained in
this document represent the best possible solutions for our employees.
The final decision will be based on your input using the process
described below.

***Schedule Selection Process***

In mid-2020, we will be implementing a 24/7 schedule on 2 or 3 of the
Saltine Lines. The number of lines we implement on will be determined by
the customer demand at the time of implementation along with the
preferences of the workforce.

The selection process will answer the two following questions:

1.  What will be the schedules be for the Day Shift and for the Night
    Shift when we go 24/7 on some of our Saltine lines?

2.  Which shift and schedule would you prefer to be assigned to?

Everyone will have a few days to review the contents of this document
before using the last page (Preference Form) to let the company know
which schedule and shifts you most prefer. The forms need to be
submitted to the Human Resource Department no later than 8:00 am on
Tuesday, December 17^th^.

**[24/7 Schedule Options]{.underline}*: ***

There are 2 Day shift patterns to choose from as well as 2 Night shift
patterns to choose from. The Day shift pattern and the Night shift
pattern DO NOT need to be the same pattern.

[The Day Shift Patterns:]{.underline}

Option #1 is the 2-3-2 pattern with every other weekend off as a 3-day
weekend.

Option #2 is the 4/3 pattern which is the same pattern currently being
worked by maintenance.

[The Night Shift Patterns:]{.underline}

Option #1 is the 3-on-3-off pattern where you work 3 weekends in a row
and then get three weekends off in a row.

Option #2 is the 4/3 pattern which is the same pattern currently being
worked by maintenance.

**Current Schedule (Saltines)**

**13 workdays in a row then 1 day off (8-hour shifts)**

![](media/image2.emf)

**How the schedule works**

In the schedule above, an "8" represents an 8-hour shift.

This schedule has a 2-week cycle. In the first week, you work seven
days, Sunday through Saturday. Rotating down to the second week, you
work six days in a row, Sunday -- Friday. Following the stretch of 13
days of work in a row, you get one day off on Saturday.

Variations may include having a day off other than Saturday. This
schedule represents "peak" season and is not generally expected to be
used year-round.

**24/7 Coverage Day Shift Option #1: 2-3-2**

**Every Other Weekend Off**

![](media/image3.emf)

**How the schedule works**

In the schedule above, an "D12" represents a 12-hour Day shift from 6:00
am until 6:00 pm. The Key Feature is that every other weekend is off as
a 3-day weekend.

There are two weeks in this schedule's cycle. The two crews on Days will
each start in a different week.

Starting in week 1, the 2-week cycle will look like this:

Sunday is off. Work 12-hour shifts on Monday and Tuesday. Take off
Wednesday and Thursday. Work Friday and Saturday.

Rotate down to week 2.

Work Sunday. Take off Monday and Tuesday. Work Wednesday and Thursday.
Take off Friday and Saturday.

Rotate up to week 1 and take Sunday off as you begin the cycle again.

In this way, you have every other weekend off as a 3-day weekend
(Friday, Saturday and Sunday off).

**24/7 Coverage Day Shift Option #2: 4-3 pattern**

![](media/image4.emf)

**How the schedule works**

In the schedule above, an "D12" represents a 12-hour Day shift from 6:00
am until 6:00 pm. The Key Feature is that you have the same days of work
and the same days off every week (with the exception of Wednesdays which
are worked on alternating weeks).

This Day shift schedule is staffed using 2 crews. Crew A rotates through
the top two-week pattern and Crew B rotates through the bottom two-week
pattern.

[Going through a 2-week cycle for Crew A]{.underline}

Crew A starts in week 1 and works Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. The crew
then takes off Wednesday through Saturday before rotating down to week
2.

Crew A, now in week 2, works Sunday through Wednesday. The crew then
takes off Thursday, Friday, and Saturday before rotating back up to week
1 and starting all over again.

[Going through a 2-week cycle for Crew B]{.underline}

Crew B starts in week 1 and is off Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. The crew
then works Wednesday through Saturday before rotating down to week 2.

Crew B, now in week 2, is off Sunday through Wednesday. The crew then
works Thursday, Friday and Saturday before rotating back up to week 1
and starting all over again.

**24/7 Coverage Night Shift Option #1: 3-on-3-off modified**

![](media/image5.emf)

**How the schedule works**

In the schedule above, an "N12" represents a 12-hour Night shift from
6:00 pm until 6:00 am. Nights start on the day showed and get off the
following morning. The Key Feature is that you mostly work 3 days in a
row followed by 3 days off. There is one place where you work 2 days in
a row and another where you work 4 days in a row. This is done to give
you full weekends off.

There are 6 weeks in this schedule's cycle. The two crews on Nights will
each start 3 weeks apart. For example, if crew C starts in week 1, then
Crew D will start in week 4.

Starting in week 1, the 6-week cycle will look like this:

Week 1: Start Sunday night at 6:00 pm and work 12 hours. Work Monday
night and Tuesday night; getting off on Wednesday morning. Take off
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday; returning to work Saturday night at 6:00
pm. Rotate down to week 2.

Week 2: Work Sunday and Monday nights; ending at 6:00 am Tuesday
morning. Take off Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, returning to work
Friday night. Work Friday and Saturday night. Rotate down to week 3.

Week 3: Work Sunday night. Take off Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday;
returning to work Thursday night. Work Friday night and take off
Saturday night. Rotate down to week 4.

Week 4: Take off Sunday through Tuesday; returning to work Wednesday
night. Work Wednesday, Thursday and Friday night. Take off Saturday and
rotate down to week 5.

Week 5: Take off Sunday and Monday. Work Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
night. Take off Friday and Saturday night. Rotate down to week 6.

Week 6: Take off Sunday. Work Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Take
off Thursday and Friday; returning to work Saturday night. Work Saturday
night then rotate up to week 1.

**24/7 Coverage Night Shift Option #2: 4-3 pattern**

![](media/image6.emf)

**How the schedule works**

In the schedule above, an "N12" represents a 12-hour Night shift from
6:00 pm until 6:00 am. The Night shift starts on the day shown and ends
the following morning. The Key Feature is that you have the same days of
work and the same days off every week (except for Wednesdays which are
worked on alternating weeks).

This Night shift schedule is staffed using 2 crews. Crew C rotates
through the top two-week pattern and Crew C rotates through the bottom
two-week pattern.

[Going through a 2-week cycle for Crew C]{.underline}

Crew A starts in week 1 and works Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. The crew
then takes off Wednesday through Saturday before rotating down to week
2.

Crew A, now in week 2, works Sunday through Wednesday. The crew then
takes off Thursday, Friday, and Saturday before rotating back up to week
1 and starting all over again.

[Going through a 2-week cycle for Crew D]{.underline}

Crew B starts in week 1 and is off Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. The crew
then works Wednesday through Saturday before rotating down to week 2.

Crew B, now in week 2, is off Sunday through Wednesday. The crew then
works Thursday, Friday and Saturday before rotating back up to week 1
and starting all over again.

**Questions and Answers**

**[Question #1:]{.underline}** What are our options?

**[Answer #1:]{.underline}** There are two options for each shift going
to a 24/7 schedule.

1.  Day Shift

    a.  Option #1: 2-3-2 pattern (Every other weekend off)

    b.  Option #2: 4-3 pattern (Same days off)

2.  Night Shift

    a.  Option #1: 3-on-3-off modified (Work 3 weekends, off 3 weekends)

    b.  Option #2: 4-3 pattern (Same days off)

**[Question #2:]{.underline}** Who has to go to the 24/7 schedule and
when will the schedule be implemented?

**[Answer #2:]{.underline}** We plan on taking at least 2, and possibly
3 of the saltine lines to 24/7 operations. To support the lines, we will
need to take some of the people in Mixing to a 24/7 schedule as well.

**[Question #3:]{.underline}** I work in an area that is already working
a 24/7, 12-hour schedule. Will we need to change?

**[Answer #3:]{.underline}** No. Those currently on 24/7, 12-hour
schedules rated those schedules very high. They will be kept in place,
unchanged.

**[Question #4:]{.underline}** If I'm in Wirecuts or Sandwiches, will I
have to change? Can we change if we want to?

**[Answer #4:]{.underline}** The only change planned is for 2 or 3 of
the Saltine lines along with enough people from Mixing to support the
change. We will be adding people to our facility in order to staff the
new schedules. If current employees want to go to the new schedules, we
will try to accommodate them. If we cannot fully staff the Saltine lines
with current employees, we will fill the openings with new hires. In
short, we will place current employees where they want to go (so far as
we are able) and then hire into the openings that are left, wherever
they may be.

**[Question #5:]{.underline}** Will there be any changes to any other
areas?

**[Answer #5:]{.underline}** No. We considered starting Wirecuts on
Sunday nights instead of Monday nights but the surveys showed that less
than half of you thought that was a good idea. Additionally, when we
asked about the shift times for the 8-hour shifts, most of you preferred
to keep things as they are.

**[Question #6:]{.underline}** How will the new schedule be chosen?

**[Answer #6:]{.underline}** On the Preference Form at the end of this
document, you will tell us what 24/7 patterns you most prefer for Day
and Night shift. You will also tell us if you want to go those patterns
and on which shift. We will implement the schedule that has the most
support from the affect employees.

**[Question #7:]{.underline}** How will it be decided who goes to what
shift?

**[Answer #7:]{.underline}** We will use the following criteria:

1.  People assigned to a line/area will have priority to stay on that
    line/area.

2.  People currently on Day shift will have first priority to stay on
    Day shift.

3.  Where do you want to go? (as expressed on the Preference Form at the
    end of this document)

4.  How long have you worked here?

5.  What are you already qualified to do?

6.  Performance and attendance.

**[Question #8]{.underline}**: When will we know our new schedule?

**[Answer #8:]{.underline}** The new schedule will be announced sometime
in January. This includes letting people know what shift they will be
assigned to.

**[Question #8]{.underline}**: Why is attendance one of the criteria to
be considered when placing people on a schedule or shift?

**[Answer #8:]{.underline}** The whole idea behind implementing a
12-hour, 24/7 schedule is to let our lines to keep running while giving
people time off. A 12-hour schedule provides 78 more annual days off
than an 8-hour schedule that works Monday through Friday. A 12-hour
schedule provides 158 more annual days off than an 8-hour 13&1 schedule.
However, if people on the 12-hour schedules call off and have high
absenteeism, this will cause others to come in on days that they
expected to have off. In order to meet people's expectations of more
days off on 12-hour schedules, we want to staff our crews with people
that have the best attendance possible.

To be clear, we expect you to stay at home when you are sick. We also
expect you to enjoy your vacation time. However, high absenteeism beyond
that is not suitable for the 12-hour schedules.

**[Question #9]{.underline}**: When will overtime be paid on the 24/7
schedule?

**[Answer #9:]{.underline}**

If the 12-hour schedule is implemented:

1.  Overtime at time and one-half will be paid for all hours worked
    outside of your regularly scheduled hours, if you work all of your
    regularly scheduled hours.

2.  Overtime at time and one-half will be paid for all hours worked over
    40 in a week.

3.  Double-time will be paid for all hours worked in excess of 60 hours
    during a workweek.

**[Question #10:]{.underline}** When we are scheduled for 12-hour
shifts, can we be made to work more than 12 hours in a day?

**[Answer #10:]{.underline}** Our goal will be to have no one working
more than 12 hours in a day. There may be times when a brief meeting or
something of that nature overrides this goal but in general, a 12-hour
day is all you will be required to work.

**[Question #11:]{.underline}** How will vacation work?

**[Answer #11:]{.underline}** On the 12-hour schedules, vacation will be
taken and paid in hours. If you miss a 12-hour shift, you will be paid
for 12 hours and 12 hours will be charged to your account. On 12-hour
schedules, it is often seen as beneficial to take off a "block" of days.
A "block" is defined as a group of consecutive days of work that are
proceeded and followed by a group of days off. If you choose to take a
"block" off, you will not be subjected to mandatory overtime on the days
off immediately preceding and following your vacation days.

**[Question #12]{.underline}**: How will the new schedules affect my
income?

**[Answer #12:]{.underline}** It depends on how much overtime you work.

Your current schedule averages 40 hours a week with 40 hours of pay.
This is before unscheduled overtime.

The 12-hour schedule averages 42 hours of work per week and 44 hours of
pay before unscheduled overtime.

So, if you don't work any unscheduled overtime the 12-hour schedule will
pay 10% more than your current schedule. (See *Appendix B* for pay
calculations).

Now, on a 13&1, 8-hour schedule, there is a lot of additional overtime
and thus, a lot more pay. This schedule averages 52 hours of work per
week and 60 hours of pay. See *Appendix C* to see how much you would
earn if you worked an equivalent number of hours on a 12-hour schedule.

**[Question #14:]{.underline}** How will holidays work?

**[Answer #14:]{.underline}** There are three considerations surrounding
holidays: (1) Will we work them, (2) What is the **holiday premium** if
I work on a holiday and (3) What is the **holiday pay** if I don't work
on a holiday. Let's take these one at a time:

**Will we work on a holiday?** That depends on the needs of the
business. Take a look at how often we have worked on a holiday in the
past and use that as a guide. We'd like to take every holiday off but
sometimes we will need to run some line.

**What is the rate of pay if I work on a holiday?** You will be paid
double-time for all hours worked on a holiday. This is in addition to
holiday pay (below). Pay for hours worked on a holiday is referred to as
***Holiday Premium***. Note that [Holiday Premium]{.underline} is
different from [Holiday Pay]{.underline} (below).

**What is the rate of holiday pay?** Holiday pay for the 12-hour
schedules will depend if a holiday falls on a scheduled day off or on a
scheduled workday. If a holiday falls on a regularly scheduled day off,
you will get 8 hours of holiday pay. If a holiday falls on a scheduled
workday, you will get 12 hours of holiday pay. See *Appendix D* for
Holiday Pay calculations.

**[Question #15]{.underline}**: On the 12-hour schedule, if I volunteer
to work overtime on a day off, does it have to be for 12 hours?

**[Answer #15]{.underline}**: No. Being flexible on how long an overtime
shift must be is one of the advantages of a 12-hour schedule. So long as
it is manageable, and agreed to in advance with your supervisor, the
number of hours you will work, we want to be flexible.

If several people want overtime, it will be first offered to those that
are willing to work the entire 12-hour shift.

**[Question #15]{.underline}**: If I'm on the 12-hour schedule, can I be
made to work overtime on a non-12-hour schedule?

**[Answer #15]{.underline}**: No. Here is how overtime will work:

1.  If overtime is required on a 12-hour line, it will first be offered
    to volunteers on the 12-hour line. If there are no volunteers, we
    may look for volunteers from the 8-hour line.

2.  If there are not enough volunteers to cover an opening on a 12-hour
    line, then it will be the responsibility of the 12-hour line crew
    that is off to provide coverage.

**[Question #16]{.underline}**: Will I get additional breaks on the
12-hour shifts?

**[Answer #16:]{.underline}** Yes. All 12-hour shifts will have four
15-minute paid rest periods in addition to a 20-minute paid lunch.

**[Question #17]{.underline}**: What about Bereavement Leave?

**[Answer #17:]{.underline}** You will be allowed the same number of
paid days off on a 24/7 schedule as you are currently allowed on the
traditional schedule.

**[Question #16:]{.underline}** How will shift differentials be paid on
the 12-hour schedule?

**[Answer #16:]{.underline}** On the 12-hour schedule, employees on the
24/7 Night Shift schedule will receive a shift differential of
\$.50/hour for all 12 hours

**Appendix A -- Staffing**

**Staffing on the 24/7 schedule in Saltines and Mixing, will depend on
what Saltine lines make the move to the new schedule. There are 4 lines
so here is how each line's staffing would change is it is one of the
24/7 lines.**

**Appendix C -- Overtime Pay Calculations**

This example uses \$16 an hour as a sample rate of pay. If you make more
than \$16 an hour, the amount you earn will be greater than that shown.
If you make less than \$16 an hour, the amount you earn will be less
than that shown.

**Current schedule: 13-on-1-off**

Average Work Hours per Week: 52 hours

Annual Days Off 26 (If kept in place all year)

Annual Workdays 338

Annual Income with OT \$49,920 (\$16 x 52 weeks x 60 pay hours per week)

**Monday -- Friday, 8-hour shifts**

Average Work Hours per Week: 40 hours

Annual Days Off 104

Annual Workdays 260

Annual Base Income \$33,280 (\$16 x 52 weeks x 40 pay hours per week)

**24/7 12-hour option**

Average Work Hours per Week: 42 hours

Annual Days Off 182

Annual Workdays 182

Annual Base Income \$36,608 (\$16 x 52 weeks x 44 pay hours per week)

See calculations on the next page to see how working more overtime will
impact your income and number of days off.

You will notice that the 13-on-1-off schedule has the most money. It
also has the highest hours of work per week and the fewest days off.
This is because it is a high overtime schedule. If you work more
overtime on ANY schedule you will make more money and have fewer days
off. The charts below show how much more money (and fewer days off) you
will get if you work more and more overtime on the 12-hour schedule.

There is some variability in how much you could earn. This is because if
you work all of your overtime on your 48-hour week, you will quickly get
to the 60-hour limit, after which, overtime is paid at the double-time
rate. However, if you spread your overtime out so that you work a lot
but never more than 60 hours in a week, you will not reach the
double-time rate.

The income is using a \$16 an hour pay rate as an example.

![](media/image17.emf)

![](media/image18.emf)

**Appendix D -- Holiday Pay**

On your current schedule, there are 8 regular holidays plus 2 bonus
holidays. On your current schedule, you work an 8-hour shift and get 8
hours of holiday pay every holiday. The calculations below assume that
you take the holiday off, miss 8 hours and get 8 hours of holiday pay to
make up for the lost hours.

![](media/image19.emf)

On the 12-hour schedules, there are still 8 regular holidays plus 2
bonus holidays. On 12-hour schedules, you only work 50% of the days in
the year. This means that, on average, a regular holiday will fall on
half of the days you are scheduled to work and on half of the days you
are scheduled off. A bonus holiday will always fall on a workday. If a
holiday falls on a workday, you miss 12 hours of work and get 12 hours
of pay on that day. If a holiday falls on a day off, you get 8 hours of
holiday pay even though you missed no work. In the end, you can see that
you do not lose money due to this way of paying holiday pay. In fact,
you gain 32 hours of holiday pay per year, on average.
