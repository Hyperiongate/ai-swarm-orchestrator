🔴 CURRENT BLOCKING ISSUE

Domain Not Connected to Website

Symptom:

When visiting swingshift.com, user sees:

\'swingshift.com is parked free, courtesy of Godaddy.com\'

Root Cause:

The domain (swingshift.com) is not connected to the Websites + Marketing
site that Jim has been building. The website EXISTS in draft form, but
the domain is in \'parked\' status.

Why This Happened:

-   • Domain was initially set to forward to shift-work.com (we fixed
    this)

-   • After removing forwarding, domain reverted to \'parked\' status

-   • Need to explicitly connect domain to the website

⚡ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

STEP 1: Connect Domain to Website (MUST DO FIRST)

Method A: From Website Dashboard

-   1\. Go to GoDaddy Dashboard → Click \'Website\'

-   2\. Find \'Shiftwork Solutions LLC\' website

-   3\. Look for \'Connect Domain\' button or status

-   4\. Click \'Connect Domain\'

-   5\. Select \'swingshift.com\' from dropdown

-   6\. Click \'Apply\' or \'Save\'

-   7\. Wait 10-30 minutes for DNS propagation

Method B: From Domain Dashboard

-   1\. Go to GoDaddy Dashboard → Click \'Domain\'

-   2\. Click on swingshift.com

-   3\. In \'Quick Links\' section, click \'Connect Domain\'

-   4\. Choose \'Website\' as destination

-   5\. Select \'Websites + Marketing\' site

-   6\. Click \'Connect\' or \'Apply\'

Expected Result:

After connection + DNS propagation (10-30 min):

-   • swingshift.com will show the website being built

-   • Not the parking page

-   • HTTPS will work with padlock

STEP 2: Publish Website (After Domain Connected)

Once domain is connected:

-   1\. Go to Website dashboard

📝 FINAL NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

User is capable and motivated but needs clear guidance:

-   • Provide exact click-by-click instructions

-   • Ask for screenshots to confirm current state

-   • Anticipate issues (like domain not connecting)

-   • User did nothing wrong

-   • Simple configuration step that GoDaddy doesn\'t make obvious

User has made excellent progress in one session:

-   • Email operational

-   • SSL configured

-   • Website builder accessed and homepage started

-   • Strategic plan documented

-   • Just needs domain connection to go live
